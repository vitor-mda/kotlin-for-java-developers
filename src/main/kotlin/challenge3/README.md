# ðŸ§  Challenge #3

Challenge done during **Section 5: OO and Kotlin: Classes, Functions, Inheritance**.

## ðŸŽ¯ Tasks
1. Translate the Java classes `Bicycle`, `MountainBike` and `RoadBike` to Kotlin, prepending `Kotlin` to their names.
2. Instantiate `KotlinBicycle` and its subclasses and then call their `printDescription` methods.
3. Make `KotlinBicycle`'s `gear` property optional with a standard value of `10`.
4. Do the same as #2, but without passing a `gear` value.
5. Add a secondary constructor do `KotlinMountainBike` which accepts a `color` parameter of type `String` and then prints it.
6. Add a companion object to `KotlinMountainBike` which haves a `List<String>` property called `availableColors`. Initialize it with the colors blue, red, white, black, green and brown.
7. Print each color in `KotlinMountainBike`'s `availableColors`.
