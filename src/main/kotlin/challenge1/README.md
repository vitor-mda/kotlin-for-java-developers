# ðŸ§  Challenge #1

Challenge done during **Section 3: Basic Differences Between Kotlin and Java**.

## ðŸŽ¯ Tasks
1. Declare two immutable String variables called `hello1` and `hello2`. Assign "Hello" to both variables.
2. Using one line of code, test whether `hello1` and `hello2` are referentially equal. Print the result.
3. Do the same thing as #2, but test for structural equality.
4. Declare a mutable variable of type Int and assign it the value of 2988.
5. Declare an immutable variable of type Any and assign it the string:
   ```kotlin
   "The Any type is the root of the Kotlin class hierarchy"
   ```
    Then, using a smart cast, print out the upper-cased string.
6. Using one statement, print out the following. Make sure your code is nicely indented.
   ```shell
      1
     11
    111
   1111
   ```
7. Do the same as above but using `trimMargin` with `"1"` as margin prefix instead of `trimIndent`
