# ðŸ§  Challenge #2

Challenge done during **Section 4: Data Types and Null Reference Handling**.

## ðŸŽ¯ Tasks
1. Declare a non-nullable float variable two ways, and assign it the value `-3847.384`
2. Now change both of those variable declarations into nullable variables.
3. Now declare an array of type non-nullable `Short`. Make it size 5, and assign it the values 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.
4. Now declare an array of nullable `Int`s and initialize it with the values 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, etc., all the way up to 200.
5. You have to call a Java method with the following signature from Kotlin:
    ```java
    public void method1 (char[] charArray)
    ```
    Declare an array that you could pass to the method and initialize it with the values `'a'`, `'b'` and `'c'`.
6. Given the following code:
   ```kotlin
    val x: String? = "I AM IN UPPERCASE"
   ```
    Using one line of code, declare another string variable, and assign it `x.lowercase()` when `x` isn't null, and the string `"I give up!"` when `x` is null.
7. Now use the `let` function to **(a)** lowercase the string, and then **(b)** replace `"am"` with `"am not"` in the result
8. You're really, really confident that the variable `myNonNullVariable` can't contain null. Change the following code to assert that `myNonNullVariable` isn't null (and shoot yourself in the foot!)
   ```kotlin
   val myNonNullVariable: Int? = null
   myNonNullVariable?.toDouble()
   ```
